    <p> Speak to others of your plans to visit Puglia, and one of the first things they’re likely to mention are the trulli. 

        These curious conical-roofed whitewashed structures, clustered in pockets of Puglia like wild fungi, are an icon of the region. In fact, this peaceful part of southern Italy is the only place they have ever existed. 
        
        It is to view Puglia's finest and largest concentration of trulli which brings people to Alberobello, a town of just over 10,000 people. As one of the ‘must do’ items on everyone’s itinerary, the town has inevitably become a little overcrowded with daytrippers and tour groups, but it can still be enjoyed if you visit early and with your expectations managed.
        
        Here’s our guide on how to get the most out of your time in Alberobello, including things to see, where to park and where to stay if you want to visit for more than a day trip.</p>
